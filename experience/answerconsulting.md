## My Journey at Renuo

### Introduction üåü

Renuo AG is a medium-sized company located in the beautiful municipality of Wallisellen, near the city of Z√ºrich. I joined this amazing family in September 2022, at the age of 23, and I am very grateful to be part of such a wonderful company.

The secret of Renuo's success lies in its partners‚Äîamazing people with a clear and inspiring vision on how to run a company. Fairness, transparency, and responsibility are among the many values taught and daily applied at Renuo. My job at Renuo involves working on a Swisscom project called Renovero.

### Key Projects and Achievements üèÜ

Renovero is a Swiss platform designed to help users find tasks for craftsmen. Users can post jobs on the platform, and certified companies will send them quotes for the job. I joined the Renovero team as a backend engineer, and over time, my role has become increasingly influential. Here are some of the key features I am working on:

- **Database Optimization**: I split the database into master and read replicas to avoid downtimes due to high workload, enhancing the platform's reliability.
- **Data Integration**: Leading the development of a custom integration to import companies' data from Localsearch, optimizing the server's workload.
- **Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade**: Spearheading the strategy for upgrading the Kubernetes cluster, avoiding downtimes and outages while improving the infrastructure setup.
- **Salesforce Integration**: Conceptualizing and implementing the integration of the platform with Salesforce, fully automating the process of importing contracts and boosting operator efficiency.
- **AWS EKS Cluster Maintenance**: Maintaining and optimizing the platform's infrastructure on the AWS EKS cluster.
- **Social Login Implementation**: Adding social login features to reduce customer friction during login.
- **Elasticsearch Configuration**: Configuring and maintaining an integration with Elasticsearch to boost contractors' search experience and word search capabilities.
- **AI Integration and LLMs**: Supervising the integration of AI on Renovero, working with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the platform's capabilities. Implementing machine learning models to personalize user experience and improve search algorithms.
- **Embedded Models Experiments**: Conducting experiments with embedded models on Elasticsearch to further improve the search experience for our customers.
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Constantly working to reduce technical debt, keeping the codebase monitored daily to ensure high performance and maintainability.
- **Code Quality Procedures**: Introducing procedures to raise and ensure high code quality on each pull request, including the implementation of static code analysis tools.
- **Complex Infrastructure Management**: Managing the complex infrastructure of Renovero, which spans multiple services and two major cloud providers, GCP and AWS.

In March 2023, I suggested an approach to implement AI on Renovero that was accepted by the CEO and is currently being implemented.

In May 2024, due to my dedication to the project and deep understanding of the business and the project, I became the tech lead of the Renovero project at Renuo.

#### Project Presentation Writer: Adding Magic to Presentations ‚ú®

Another exciting project I am following at Renuo is Presentation Writer, an AI Assistant that enhances presentations. This tool looks at your camera and allows you to draw on the screen you‚Äôre presenting on. It serves as an assistant during presentations, adding a magic touch and impressing your listeners.

### Additional Responsibilities üîß

At Renuo, I also have other responsibilities, such as configuring meeting room equipment and leading the process of hiring new team members. What I appreciate most is the fact that Renuo has allowed me to develop a 360-degree skill set.

### Professional Development and Company Culture üå±

One of Renuo's key values is togetherness and exploring new ways. I love the close cooperation always experienced within the company. Renuo encourages continuous learning and professional growth, and I invest time in attending various conferences and workshops, with a focus on AI and emerging technologies. This commitment to learning helps me stay at the forefront of technological advancements and brings new insights to my work.

### Conclusion üéì
